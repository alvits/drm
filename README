This is the README for Dynamic Reconfiguration Management.

Makefile is written to generate the following executables.

DOMSERVER=dom0 - This is the server daemon for the hypervisor that listens for connections and accepts messages from domUs.

TESTDOMU=domU - This is a test client for domUs to send a test message t dom0.

DOMCLIENT=dom_relay - This is a domU client that relays messages received from JVMs thru domain socket and sends them to dom0.

TESTSERVER=threadserver - This is a domU test server to test domain sockets without relaying to domU. This is basically dom_relay without connectivity to dom0.

TESTCLIENT=testclient - This is a domU test client to send test messages.

TESTPE=testpe - This is the client code to send message to Policy Engine.

The following macros are defined on Makefile.

__USE_POSIX - To use posix source code compilation directive.

The following set of macros will be disabled for production executables.

DEBUG_DRM - To print debug messages.
